# ScreenBlindfold
A program to prevent screenshots and screen recordings of the screen.

When ScreenBlindfold is enabled, it will open an invisible window across the entire screen which blocks screenshots and screen recordings of the covered area. It supports multiple monitors. However, it cannot prevent screenshots or screen recordings of the taskbar and Start menu and certain full-screen apps and certain apps that "stay on top". It can be set to run at startup and will remember the previous state the program was in (i.e. it will automatically re-enable the blindfold if it was enabled before).

Use cases of the program:

- Temporarily hiding sensitive information while screen sharing in video calls
- Preventing programs from seeing the screen while checking sensitive information such as banking info (IMPORTANT: This program is NOT a substitute for antivirus software. Please make sure your computer is malware-free otherwise.)
- Preventing parental control software such as Covenant Eyes from taking screenshots of the screen
- Protecting confidential business or personal information from being captured in screenshots or screen recordings
- Securing intellectual property or trade secrets displayed on screen during meetings or presentations
- Preventing online proctors or examiners from capturing sensitive information during online exams or assessments (IMPORTANT: This program is NOT meant to be used to bypass proctoring during exams. You must follow all academic integrity guidelines when using this program.)
- Protecting personal privacy by preventing others from taking screenshots or recording your screen without your permission
- Helping to maintain compliance with data privacy regulations by preventing unauthorized capturing of sensitive information on screen.

The program is compatible with 10, 11 and newer. Work to support Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8 is in progress.
